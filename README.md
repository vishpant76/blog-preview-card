## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox


### What I learned


- Using `clamp` to dynamically adjust the font-size on varying screen sizes.

- Got more practice with using CSS variables.

- Using Figma to inspect the provided design files to make more concrete decisions on the various CSS properties instead of relying on guesswork.



### Continued development

- Still not very comfortable with transitions and box shadows. Looking forward to more such exercises to practice applying subtle and smooth transitions.

- Flexbox concepts are still shaky. Need more practice on letting an element shrink to content instead of forcibly trying to control its width. A good example is setting the display type of the flex item rather than its width, to change its size behavior - something I struggled to think of in this project.
